Theoriq AI Agent Swarm
Theoriq Agents = A football team of 11 superstars
LLM Agents = A football team of 1 superstar

👏 Then, who would win? Theoriq Agents vs LLM Agents? 👇

Yesterday Ron Bodkin 
@ronbodkin
  - CEO of 
@TheoriqAI
 shared his thoughts on the rise of Web2 agent system, and compare Theoriq Swarm with Google's Agent2Agent system. 

In his blog, which you can find more details in the quoted link below, there are some key points that you don't want to miss:

1⃣ Big rising of Collaborative AI
AI agents are evoling from single, isolated agents into collaborative AI agents to solve more complex problems. They are play collectively like a super star football team, in which each player has it owns role:
- Coach: to provide direction and strategy
- Goalkeeper: to protect the network from any attack and prevent loss
- Defender: to blocks incoming threats, safeguards the network
- Team Captain: to decide the signal switch between defense and attack based on the market condtion
- Striker: to execute (to score goals by executing liquidity strategies and transactions).
- Assistant Coach: to do backtesting job, running simulation to optimize performance of the team
👏 Theoriq Swarm agents are playing as a team, not relying on a single superstar.

2⃣ What makes Theoriq Agents coordination different:
Theoriq Agents Swarm can interact autonomously. All actions are recorded on blockchain by generating tamper proof. And these Agents are built in a decentralized manner that boost the open collaboration and participation by the community 👏 => solve the complex problem in real time

3⃣Unique features of Theoriq Agents:
👏 Autonomous execution: agents act and making decisions and executing actions autonomously and dynamically based on tasks and conditions.

👏Evaluator Agents: they are specific AI Agents within the system (like the example of the Assistant Coach above) whose job is to assess the performance of other agents in real time on many aspects like reliability, accuracy, efficiency etc. Please refer to my example above of the football team for ease of reference.

👏Native Financial Layer: it's built around $THQ token and blockchain for rewards, fees and payment purpose and with cryptographic security feature to ensure the transparency, integrity and security of the system.
